NAME
    MongoDB::Web - MongoDB + Moose + URI

SYNOPSIS
     package WebPage;
     use Moose;
     extends 'MongoDB::Web::Resource';
     # inherits the 'uri' attribute

     # this attribute is a "Property"
     # it will be stored in mongodb
     has 'title' => (
         traits => [qw( Property )],
         is => 'rw',
         isa => 'Str',
     );

     # this attribute is not a Property
     # it won't be stored
     has 'is_fresh' => (
         is => 'rw',
         isa => 'Bool',
     );

     # this property store an ArrayRef of WebPage URIs
     has outlinks => (
         traits => [qw( Property )],
         is => 'rw',
         isa => 'ArrayRefOfURI',
         uri_isa => 'WebPage',
         coerce => 1,
     );

     package main;
     use MongoDB::Web::Store;

     my $store = MongoDB::Web::Store->new(
         database => MongoDB::Connection->new(host => 'localhost', port => 27017)->test_database
     );

     # new resources
     my $page1 = WebPage->new(
         uri => 'http://example.org/1',
         outlinks => [ 'http://example.org/2' ],
     );
     $store->save($page1);

     my $page2 = WebPage->new(
         uri => 'http://example.org/2',
         outlinks => [ 'http://example.org/1' ],
     );
     $store->save($page2);
 
     # load resources
     my $loaded = $store->load_by_uri('http://example.org/1'); # this is page1 

     my $cursor = $store->load_referers( WebPage => outlinks => $page2 );
     $loaded = $cursor->next; # this is $page1

DESCRIPTION
    MongoDB Object Mapper that is designed to store Web Resources (ie:
    Object that are identified by an URI)

METHODS
  $class->canonical_uri( $uri )
    This method is used internaly to validate the URIs and to make them
    canonical. It is critical to store the URIs in their canonical form as
    they are used as primary keys. This method is used for the validation
    and the coercion of the URI and ArrayRefOfURI attributes.

  $class->set_alternate_canonical_uri_maker( sub { my $uri = shift; ...; return $uri; } )
    You can provide your own canonical_uri method as a replacement of the
    standard one.
